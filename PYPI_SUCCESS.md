## 🚀 Next Steps: Launch Marketing

### Week 1: Reddit + Hacker News
**Reddit posts (copy-paste ready):**

**r/Python:**
```
Title: I built Argus - Open Source Observability for AI Agents (like Sentry for LLMs)

I'm 17 and spent the last month building Argus - an open-source tool that gives you X-ray vision into your AI agents.

Problem: AI agents are expensive black boxes. One developer burned $847 in 11 minutes because GPT-4 called itself 2,341 times in a loop.

Solution: One decorator. Complete visibility.

pip install hundredeyes

Features:
- Real-time cost tracking (auto-calculated for OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere)
- Latency monitoring (p50, p95, p99)
- Agent loop detection
- Beautiful dashboard (Vercel/Linear style)
- <1ms overhead
- All data stays local (no SaaS)

GitHub: https://github.com/sh1esty1769/argus
PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/hundredeyes/

Built with Flask + SQLite. MIT licensed. Would love feedback!
```

**r/MachineLearning:**
```
Title: [P] Argus - Open Source Observability for AI Agents

Built an open-source observability tool for AI agents. Think Sentry/DataDog but for LLMs.

One decorator gives you:
- Automatic cost calculation (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere)
- Latency tracking
- Agent loop detection (prevent $847 disasters)
- Error tracking
- Beautiful dashboard

pip install hundredeyes

GitHub: https://github.com/sh1esty1769/argus

All data stays on your machine. No cloud, no monthly fees.

Feedback welcome!
```

**r/LangChain:**
```
Title: Built observability tool with native LangChain integration

Made an open-source tool for monitoring LangChain agents.

from argus.integrations.langchain import ArgusCallbackHandler

handler = ArgusCallbackHandler(agent_name="my-chain")
chain.run("prompt", callbacks=[handler])

Tracks costs, latency, errors automatically.

pip install hundredeyes

GitHub: https://github.com/sh1esty1769/argus

Would love feedback from the community!
```

**Hacker News:**
```
Title: Argus – Open Source Observability for AI Agents

URL: https://github.com/sh1esty1769/argus

Comment:
Hey HN! I'm 17 and built Argus - observability for AI agents.

Problem: Deployed an agent, it burned $847 in 11 minutes (GPT-4 loop). No visibility, no alerts.

Solution: One decorator. Complete observability.

- Auto cost tracking (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere)
- Latency monitoring
- Loop detection
- Local-first (SQLite)
- <1ms overhead

pip install hundredeyes

Built with Flask. MIT licensed. All data stays on your machine.

This is my first open source project. Feedback welcome!
```

### Week 2: Dev.to + Product Hunt

**Dev.to Article Title:**
"I Built Open Source Observability for AI Agents (and Prevented a $847 Disaster)"

**Product Hunt:**
- Wait until you have 50+ GitHub stars
- Post on Tuesday/Wednesday (best days)
- Prepare GIF demo of dashboard

### Week 3: Twitter Thread

Post from @maxcodesai:
```
I'm 17 and just published my first PyPI package 🎉

Argus - Open Source Observability for AI Agents
